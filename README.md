An open letter:

As one of the Top 20 on the Warpcast Rewards leaderboard, you have been clearly identified as a leader in the space: for your
wisdom, insights, attractiveness, creativity, and creativity.

I invite you to try SassyHash ðŸ’… Rewards this week, in parallel with your regular pursuit of personal excellence.

How: install frame, use Keccak256 Composer Action to write, use SassyHash Keccak256 Cast Action to read. 

Cast SassyHash anywhere. You are responsible for your own consequences. /p2p is a safe space.

Please ask in public or private if anything remains unclear! 

Best,
artlu ðŸ’…
